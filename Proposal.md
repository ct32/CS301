## Project : Character Recognition

This project aims to distinguish the image of the characters from a number plate. We will be using computer vision fundamentals and classification methods to create a program that identifies each character. The data set we will be using is from https://www.kaggle.com/kdnishanth/characterrecognitionfromnumberplate . This data set includes letter from the English alphabet and numbers 0-9. Additionally, there is multiple variations for each character and we will be using Colab to develop our project.  
#What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
The problem that we will be investigating is character recognition. This is an interesting problem to investigate because using computer vision to recognize different letters and strings can be very important in many ways. Detecting vehicle license plates, the text on signage and storefronts, or even attempting to read captcha images all make this a very interesting problem to try to come up with a solution for.

#What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
There is a short course on Computer Vision here - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision. This will be beneficial to learn how exactly to implement our algorithm. Along with this course, there are very helpful videos on youtube and thorough explanations on the internet when it comes to character recognition.

#What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?
There are various sources of information on this topic on the internet. In order to start our project, we will be using information contained on https://www.kaggle.com/kdnishanth/characterrecognitionfromnumberplate. This link provides a simple training dataset that will allow for us to train our algorithm.

#What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You #donâ€™t have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.

#How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate #and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

We can apply machine learning algorithms using the data obtained to analyze each image using image processing techniques. The classification stage will be making that decision and will determine the accuracy for identifying each character. This stage will be in charge of accepting or rejecting the data.
